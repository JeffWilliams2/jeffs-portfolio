# About

I'm a data engineer based in Texas. I build data platforms, deploy pipelines, and architect cloud infrastructure. My focus is on systems that are reliable, maintainable, and actually solve business problems.

## Background

I didn't start in tech. I studied finance at UNT, and then worked at a brokerage. That work gave me a front-row ticket to how data flows (or doesn't) through organizations. I kept finding myself more interested in building the systems than using them.

So I went back to school. Graduated with my Masters in Advanced Data Analytics in May 2025. After graduating, I joined a genomics startup as a data engineer where I built production data infrastructure processing multi-modal biomedical data.

## Engineering Philosophy

That experience shaped how I think about engineering:

- **Infrastructure as a product** — it should be documented, observable, and serve its users
- **Observability as a requirement** — if you can't see it, you can't fix it
- **Documentation as a deliverable** — the technical solution is only half the job

I presented architecture decisions to executives and learned that you have to be able to explain *why* something matters, not just *how* it works.

## Proficiencies

- **Data Engineering:** ETL/ELT pipelines, Data modeling, Data warehouse design, SQL optimization
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Redshift, EMR), Snowflake, Databricks
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark/PySpark, Apache Airflow, Dagster, dbt, Delta Live Tables
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, DuckDB, NoSQL
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CI/CD, Terraform

## Outside of Work

When I'm not building data systems, you'll find me coding side projects, hiking, or researching market trends and options strategies.
